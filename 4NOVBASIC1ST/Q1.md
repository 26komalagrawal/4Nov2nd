Question 1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.
Answer- JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

javaScript is a powerful scripting language that has become a cornerstone of modern web development. Iallows developers to create interactive and dynamic websites that can respond to user input and updatcontent in real-time. JavaScript is used to add functionality to web pages, from simple animations tcomplex applications that can run entirely in the browser
One of the key roles of JavaScript in modern web development is its ability to make websites stateful. Thimeans that JavaScript can keep track of changes to a website’s content and respond to user interactionaccordingly. For example, JavaScript can be used to create an interactive form that updates its fieldbased on user input, or a real-time chat application that updates messages as they are sent and received.
JavaScript is also used to enable dynamic web development, allowing developers to create websites that caadapt to different screen sizes and resolutions. This is particularly important in today’s mobile-firsworld, where users are accessing websites on a wide range of devices, from smartphones to tablets anlaptops. With JavaScript, developers can create responsive websites that look great and function well oany device.
